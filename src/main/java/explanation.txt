Hello, my apologies my project is late, IÕve been very busy with other final projects. NExt time i will make sure to manage my time better as it is very important to start CS projects early. Moreover, it is important to plan time for everything, as time is nothing but a social construct. You have time for everything, you just have to make it work. Thank you for reading.
